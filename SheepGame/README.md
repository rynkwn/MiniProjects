# Can you survive as a sheep in the Apacopopalys?
(Spelling of Apocalypse intentional at the time).

# How to run the program
Just have a relatively recent version of Java, download the jar, and then run that!
It's essentially a little application!

The SheepFunctionalFinal.zip contains the source code as it was written when I was
in high school.

# How to play
Use WASD to move one square over.

Use the arrow keys to jump two squares.

The game starts the moment you select a difficulty, at which point fireballs will come pouring
from every direction. Dodge the fireballs for as long as possible!

## Critical Note:
Because I was in high school and therefore evil. Only the highest difficulty level
is really worth playing. The others have significantly, significantly lower score-increase
rates.

In honor of my much younger self, I've kept this antiquated tidbit rather than balancing
the various difficulties.

# Note
Regrettably, due to some technical issues, the .jar file doesn't contain a working
version of the high scores list. Running the raw source code has everything working
however.

(Getting the raw source code to work is painful, however.
Took me hours to get it to work on my new eclipse workspace. 
If you use JCreator, however, it's much more friendly. Just run Tester.java. 
You can guess what I used as an IDE in high school. 
I am currently disinclined to providing the more
eclipse friendly version, as it would mean that I would have to redo certain edits
to get it to make a workable jar again. If you do want a copy though, I could probably
make the effort for an individual request. Just email me at rynkwn@gmail.com)
