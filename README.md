#What is this? (And a disclaimer for future employers)

A repo that's mainly intended to hold small projects I had previously created, but which
do not merit a full repo or additional work.

The quality of the code in this repo may vary wildly. Some projects were created very quickly
on the sly on public computers, and then sent to my personal computer through whatever means
were most convenient to me at the time. Some of these means may have a prejudice against
indentation. Some projects were reasonably long in length,
but were created by a much younger me in high school.

As such, some projects (Looking at you GDE) have
horrific, mind-bogglingly bad indentation, code quality, and documentation. I apologize
for this.

However, if the project is here, then it satisfies the dual requirements of being:

1) Reasonably cool.

2) Able to be released to the public without embarrassing any individuals.

In (possibly many of) these projects, creating great, readable code was neither my concern
nor my intention, and I hope that my professional
ability to produce decent code is not judged by the contents here.

Enjoy!
